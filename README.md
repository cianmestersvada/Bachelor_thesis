# Bachelor_thesis

This folder contains two MATLAB files that I wrote for my Bachelor thesis, which can be found here (in Hungarian): https://web.cs.elte.hu/blobs/diplomamunkak/bsc_alkmat/2020/temesvari_csanad.pdf

The program files are corresponding to two of the most used numerical iteration techniques, the gradient-method and the Newton-method.
